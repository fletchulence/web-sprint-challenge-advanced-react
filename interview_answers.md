# Interview Answers
Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. What are the main differences between a stateful and a functional component?

   A stateful component is used for the purposes of modular behavior - mostly when using Class components, we will separate our state to be controlled and dictated by a stateful component. The main reason for this is because we cannot use a useEffect in Class Components. Functional components accept the use of useEffect, so stateful components are not necessary

2. When does a componentWillMount function be called? What about a componentWillUpdate?

3. Define stateful logic.

4. What are the three step of creating a successful test? What is done in each phase?
